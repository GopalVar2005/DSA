Problem Statement: Given the root of a Binary Tree, return the height of the tree. The height of the tree is equal to the number of nodes on the longest path from root to a leaf.

    public int height(TreeNode root)
    {
        if(root==null)return 0;
        int left=height(root.left);
        int right=height(root.right);
        return Math.max(left,right)+1;
    }

Time Complexity: O(N)

Space Complexity: O(H)

The maximum number of recursive calls stacked at once corresponds to the longest path from the root to a leaf, which is the height of the tree.
